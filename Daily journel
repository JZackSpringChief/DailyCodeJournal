March 12, 2023 learned how to create and APP and now learning what express is... trying to figure out how express works.
My current issue with practising code in js is im not sure how or where to start? I watch the intructional video but im unsure on how to use the code or make code? further analysis is I am likening it to math, insofar that I need a problem before me in order to figure out the solution.. I must get out of the "solving problem" faze in order to succeed. I will keep myself up to date. much love, Zack
