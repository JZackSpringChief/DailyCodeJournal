March 12, 2023 learned how to create and APP and now learning what express is... trying to figure out how express works.
My current issue with practising code in js is im not sure how or where to start? I watch the intructional video but im unsure on how to use the code or make code? further analysis is I am likening it to math, insofar that I need a problem before me in order to figure out the solution.. I must get out of the "solving problem" faze in order to succeed. I will keep myself up to date. much love, Zack
March 13, 2023 I kicked off my project 1 v.1 with the idea that I will create a Roman colosseum style RPG with 3 seperate classes(classes in this context are warriors) the end point is to win and attain glory. what ever class you pick you have to fight the other 2 with no rest so odds are against you. The battle system will be a rock, paper, scissors mechanic dependant on the class and weapon you choose. classes are Samuria, Ninja, and Sage. each class with have a choice of weapon, Samuria will have Katana or bow. Ninja will have Kunai or kusarigamas. finally, Sage will have choice of Fire or Ice magic. 
I have not figure out how it will work but im Zack and I am the best so i got this.
